## Overview

This is a C# ASP.NET project for building a vacation search website called "Dache." The project is organized into several layers, including Business Logic (Dache.BL), Data Access (Dache.DAL), Data Presentation (Dache.DP), and Presentation Layer (Dache.PL). The purpose of this project is to allow users to search for vacation destinations and related information.

## Project Structure

- **Dache.BL**: This layer contains the business logic for the application. It handles the core functionality and operations of the vacation search.

- **Dache.DAL**: The Data Access Layer is responsible for interacting with the database or data sources. It includes data access methods and entities for retrieving and storing vacation-related data.

- **Dache.DP**: The Data Presentation Layer is used to format and prepare data for presentation. It may include data transformation and manipulation logic.

- **Dache.PL**: The Presentation Layer is the ASP.NET web application that serves as the user interface for the vacation search website. Users interact with the website through this layer.
